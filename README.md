# VHDL Clock for an FPGA

### What you will need to get started:
* an FPGA of some sort, I recommend a Basys 3 or DE0Nano (which is what I used for my project).
* Quartus Prime Lite edition FPGA programming software from Intel which is free, but Windows and Linux only :(
* 7 segment display that I ordered here: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1001
* 11 resistors, 200 ohm is fine
* 4 NPN Transistors to act as switches to ground for each digit.

- Updated to allow 2 push buttons of your choice to be wired up to increment the hour and minutes so that the clock can function as a real time-keeping device.

My basic setup, contact me if you need some assistance
